# Plugin directory-multiview

## Introduction

This module proposes a view of multiple directories and directory records filtered by user, depending on his unit membership in unitTree, and proposes a dashboard of those directory recordsfiltered by the workflow state of the records.

The ViewFilter has different properties :
 
* The id of the directory
* The filter name
* The rendering style for the number of records corresponding to this filter
* The display position in the dashboard
* The entry to display to represent the record in multi-type records list


The ViewFilter condition has different properties :
 
* The entry Id of the directory record whose value must match the condition
* The operator for the condition (default : "equals")
* The Type of the condition (default : unit Tree filter = the value of the entry must match a unit bound to the user )


The ViewFilter action has different properties :
 
* the state of the workflow chosen for displaying the dashboard of the number of recordscorresponding to this state, filtered by the filter condition
* The display position by action in the dashboard (not used yet)
* The rendeding style (not used yet)
* The maximum of item to display in result lists (not used yet)


## Configuration
