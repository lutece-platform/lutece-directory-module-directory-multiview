# Plugin directory-multiview

## Introduction

This module proposes a view of multiple directories and directory records filtered by user, depending on his unit membership in unitTree, and proposes a dashboard of those directory recordsfiltered by the workflow state of the records.

The ViewFilter has different properties :
 
* The id of the directory
* The filter name
* The rendering style for the number of records corresponding to this filter
* The display position in the dashboard
* The entry to display to represent the record in multi-type records list


The ViewFilter condition has different properties :
 
* The entry Id of the directory record whose value must match the condition
* The operator for the condition (default : "equals")
* The Type of the condition (default : unit Tree filter = the value of the entry must match a unit bound to the user )


The ViewFilter action has different properties :
 
* the state of the workflow chosen for displaying the dashboard of the number of recordscorresponding to this state, filtered by the filter condition
* The display position by action in the dashboard (not used yet)
* The rendeding style (not used yet)
* The maximum of item to display in result lists (not used yet)


It is possible to modify task templates for an action of a workflow to indicate if it must be redirected to the page of the directory record or on the page of the list of all records when the action has been done.The default page of the redirection when the action is done is the page of the record of the directory on which the action has been made.

## Configuration

requires at least a form / workflow / directory complete configuration

requires the conditions and actions filter configuration

## Usage

/!\ the directory entry containing the unitTree value should be indexed !

To allow the redirection on the wanted page when the action of the workflow is done you simply need to put the following line on the template of the task: `<input type="hidden" name="workflow_action_redirection" value="list"/>` There are two possible values for this parameter:
 
*  `list` : allow to redirect on the page with the list of all records
*  `details` : allow to redirect on the page of the record on which the action has been made
