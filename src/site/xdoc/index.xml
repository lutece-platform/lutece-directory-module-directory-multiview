                <p>This module proposes a view of multiple directories and directory records filtered by user, 
                    depending on his unit membership in unitTree, and proposes a dashboard of those directory records 
                    filtered by the workflow state of the records.

                    <ul>
                        <li>The directory ViewFilter represents the filter bound to a directory</li>
                        <li>The ViewFilter condition has different types :
                            <ul>
                                <li>Type unitTreeFilter : the condition stores the entry Id of the 
                                    directory record that must match a unit bound to the user
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The ViewFilter action stores the state of the workflow 
                            chosen for displaying the dashboard of the number of records 
                            corresponding to this state, filtered by the filter condition 
                        </li>

            <subsection name="Configuration">
                <p>requires at least  a form / workflow / directory complete configuration</p>
                <p>requires the conditions and actions filter configuration</p>

            <subsection name="Usage">
                 <p>/!\ the directory entry containing the unitTree value should be indexed !</p>
